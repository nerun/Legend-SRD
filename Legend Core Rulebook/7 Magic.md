Magic is inherent to *Legend*. Access to it is not restricted by culture or profession and, in many cases, magic is a commonplace element used by most people to aid their daily lives. In a high-fantasy setting, for example, most Adventurers begin with some common magic, taught to them along with all the other mundane skills of their society. In other settings magic may be less common but still apparent: it remains, however, as fundamental as the physical laws of the planet or plane of existence.

## The Pursuit of Magic

Even though the magical types work very differently and are, to a large extent, mutually exclusive, there is nothing to prevent Adventurers from learning and developing more than one magical style. An Adventurer may therefore freely learn Common Magic, dedicate himself to a god to gain Divine Magic and even learn a smattering of Sorcery. Sorcerers will more than likely have a good understanding of Common Magic but may also pray to their gods to gain a few Divine Spells.

In reality Adventurers who desire great magical power will choose one form to pursue above the others and many societies or cults consider some magical styles to be taboo – but these are cultural limitations rather than a limitation of the rules. In reality any Adventurer can pursue any magical style and develop several style simultaneously, if they so wish.

## Types of Magic

The three magical types are:

### Common Magic

Spells and cantrips that are ubiquitous to many cultures and societies. Common Magic manipulates the natural order with varying degrees of subtlety and offers a host of effects that ease daily life or augment specific endeavours, such as combat and skill use. The range of Common Magic spells an Adventurer might know may be based on how his culture has shaped and prepared its own use of magic, with some spells being more common, or accepted, than others. However the nature and effects of Common Magic are visible to all, understood by most and recognisable from one culture to another.

Although the name – Common Magic – denotes it as being rather banal, Common Magic spells can still be very powerful, if used carefully and thoughtfully. Sorcerers, Shaman or Priests might sneer at Common Magic's limitations but only the most foolish of them would ignore or denigrate Common Magic's utility and capabilities.

### Divine Magic

Divine Magic stems from the gods. It reflects their natures, ways, spheres of influence, desires, needs, successes, failures and mythic standing. Gaining access to Divine Magic requires a dedication of faith and the willingness to enter into a personal relationship with the deity worshipped. In return for this devotion the worshipper channels aspects of the god's power and abilities. With greater devotion comes greater levels of power: the more the relationship deepens the more like the god the worshipper becomes.

Divine Magic is not limited in the same way as Common Magic but it does have certain inherent restrictions based on the depth of faith and the strength of the relationship between worshippers and worshipped.

### Sorcery

Sorcerers find their power by unlocking the fabric of reality and shaping it through their ability to manipulate the rules of creation – moulding it, bending it or breaking it. Sorcery is not based on a cultural relationship with magic, or a relationship with a god: it is based on formulae and intellect and an overt desire to manipulate reality to suit the caster.

At its most fundamental level Sorcery appears to lack power. However through a mastery of manipulation, massive levels of power are possible – effects that go far beyond what is here and now and visible. The best sorcerers are rightly feared; but to pursue Sorcery to these levels requires dedication to its cause and a willingness – or need – to engage in lengthy study and research.

The learning of Sorcery may be taboo amongst some cultures and societies because it breaks the tradition of establishing a relationship with a god. This does not make Sorcery evil necessarily but it does reinforce the belief that Sorcery is essentially a self-centred activity – an acquirement of personal power that obviates the need for, and reliance upon, gods. Sorcery is the key to the universe and sorcerers are often driven to seek and attain power that places them on a par with the gods.

## Magic Points

All living creatures possess a basic affinity with magic, whether or not they ever become trained in it. It is this raw magical power that is nursed and improved by spellcasters over time. This nascent magical power fuels spells and other magical or mystical abilities and can also provide protection against magical attacks. In *Legend*, an Adventurer's magical power is measured by Magic Points. All Adventurers start play with Magic Points equal to their POW Characteristic score. An Adventurer's POW score also acts as a maximum limit for the amount of Magic Points an Adventurer can store at any one time. However there are certain things that affect available Magic Points:

  - Certain Magic Items or Spells can raise or lower these limits.
  - POW dedicated to a god or cult cannot be used for Magic Points, reducing the available number for fuelling Common Magic, Sorcery spells or other mystical abilities.

### Using Magic Points

Whenever Magic Points are used to power a spell, the total is temporarily reduced by the amount used. The Magic Point total cannot fall below zero. Using all one's Magic Points takes its toll on the body's physical reserves; if an Adventurer reaches zero Magic Points he must make a successful Resilience roll to remain conscious.

If the Resilience roll is successful, he gains a level of Fatigue (see page 88 for more on how Fatigue works); if he fails it and falls unconscious, he remains that way for a number of minutes equal to his CON subtracted from 21.

### Regaining Magic Points

Adventurers automatically regain Magic Points equal to their POW, less any POW dedicated to a Pact, every 12 hours. They will regain this amount in six hours if they are fully resting, such as sleeping, or through the use of the Meditation Advanced skill (see page 62).
