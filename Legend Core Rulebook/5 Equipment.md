Adventuring is a profession like any other and this means that success often relies on good equipment – not just on what the Adventurer knows or has experienced. This chapter covers a comprehensive array of different equipment for Adventurers, including weapons and armour and also items which might, at first glance, offer little practical value but, in the right place and at the right time, prove to be life-savers.

Games Masters should read through this chapter and decide which items are going to be available to the Adventurers based on their Cultural Background. The tables listing prices and so forth offer guidance on availability but it is perfectly possible that a barbarian village has traded with civilised merchants and therefore come into possession of goods one would not ordinarily find in a barbarian community. Similarly cultural taboos might forbid or restrict the sale of certain goods, or shortages in one commodity or another might mean availability is very limited.

Essentially Games Masters are the final arbiter on what equipment Adventurers can buy once their Adventurers have been created and all that silver is burning a hole in their purses. Just because this chapter lists something it does not mean that it is available.

## Currency

As its default currency, _Legend_ uses coins minted in lead, copper, silver and gold. The standard, everyday coins are copper and silver, with gold being the preserve of the very wealthy. The names for coins vary from place-to-place but for ease of economy, coins maintain a similar value and standard, as follows:

5 Lead Bits (LB) = 1 Copper Penny (CP)
10 Copper Pennies = 1 Silver Piece (SP)
20 Silver Pieces = 1 Gold Crown (GC)

## Armour

Armour absorbs weapon damage. Any successful attack must first penetrate an Adventurer's armour before it starts reducing Hit Points. This simple fact alone makes armour an essential for any Adventurer intending to face great peril or deliberately seek out dangerous challenges.

However, armour is not infallible: every piece of armour has certain limitations and weak-spots and a well-aimed or well-timed blow can bypass armour completely. So a total reliance on armour  - even good metal armour – is perhaps misplaced. For comfort, and as part of its protection, all armour is considered lined or padded.

# equipment

Each piece of armour is characterised by the following qualities:

**AP:** How many Armour Points are given to each location covered by this type of armour. If an Adventurer is wearing multiple pieces of armour on a location, only the highest Armour Point score is used.

**ENC:** The weight and bulk of the armour. See page 86 for more details on Encumbrance and its effects on Adventurers.

**Locations:** Which Hit Locations this type of armour protects.

**Cost:** The average cost in Silver Pieces to purchase this armour.

### Armour Effects on Strike Rank and Movement

The more and/or heavier, the armour worn, the more restricted and slower an Adventurer is likely to be in combat. Total the APs for each armoured location and divide the result by five, rounding up. The result is the Armour Penalty applied to the Adventurer's Strike Rank.

_For example a chainmail shirt covers three locations for 5 AP per location. This gives a total of 15 AP which, divided by five, gives an Armour Penalty of –3. A full suit of plate mail, covering seven locations at 6 AP has a total of 42 AP which, divided by 5 and rounded up, gives an Armour Penalty of –9. In combat these penalties would reduce the Strike Rank of the wearers._  The same Armour Penalty is applied to various types of Movement, such as swimming or climbing. If these penalties are too great, then the Adventurer may find themselves unable to perform such actions (see page 92).

### Effects of SIZ on Armour

Armour made for an Adventurer of SIZ 1 to 5 will have its cost and ENC halved from that shown on the Armour table. Adventurers of SIZ 21 or higher will double the cost and ENC for armour made for them.

### Armour Types

**Soft Leather** : Armour made from cured hides – the simplest form of armour usually found amongst primitive cultures but also worn in more cultivated styles where protection is important but not necessarily an essential.

**Hard Leather** : Strengthened hides and cured leather used for shields and body armour. Hard leather is the consistency of shoe leather: hard wearing yet flexible.

**Linen Cuirass:** Similar to a heavy leather cuirass but the armour is crafted from multiple layers of quilted linen. The thick, stiff fabric provides decent protection at a fraction of the weight of other materials  **Ringmail** : Bronze or iron rings sewn onto a leather backing. Heavier than leather but affords much better protection.

**Scalemail** : Similar to Ringmail but the rings are replaced with scales of metal that overlap, like the scales of a fish or serpent.

**Chainmail** : Woven metal links which, whilst heavy, are flexible and more durable than armour relying on a leather base.

**Plate** : Made of moulded individual metal plates, this armour provides excellent protection but is encumbering and comes with a heavy price tag.

##### Armour Types and Costs

```
Armour AP ENC Cost in Silver per Hit Location
Soft Leather 1 1 50
Hard Leather 2 2 100
Linen 2 1 75
Ringmail 3 2 200
Scalemail 4 2 250
Chainmail 5 3 400
Plate 6 3 1,
```
Thus, a full suit of plate, covering all seven Hit Locations, would cost 8,400 SP. A full suit of Hard Leather costs 700.

However armour does not need to be bought as a full suit: different pieces can be mixed and matched, although nobles, especially, delight in wearing crafted armour of one type. The  coverage offered by different armour types and styles is summarised in the Armour Pieces table:

## Clothing

This section is a collection of outfits and special items of clothing that are available from place-to- place. Unlike common goods, many of these items are very self-explanatory. The way someone is dressed can modify Influence rolls in certain situations. Being well dressed may offer a bonus when trying to convince poorer folk, or may bring a penalty when negotiating your way past bandits.

Apron, crafter's This is a heavy leather apron worn by smiths, glass blowers and other professionals who must withstand direct and oppressive heat. Its special design makes it heavy (2 ENC) but it can shield the wearer's chest, abdomen and upper legs from up to 10 points of heat-based damage per minute. It is awkward to move around in and imposes a –10% Evade penalty because of its stiffness.

## Weaponry

It would be unthinkable for an Adventurer to set out into danger without the means to protect himself. For many Adventurers a sword or dagger suffices but many soldiers, skilled in a variety of weapons, know that different weapons have different applications and that a sword, whilst good against one type of foe, is completely useless against another.

The assortment of weapons – Close and Ranged Combat – is extensive. Each weapon is described and the description provides any additional effects a weapon might have in a particular situation.

### Close Combat Weapons

Each Close Combat weapon is characterised by the following qualities:

**Category:** The type of weapon this is.

**Damage Dice:** The damage the weapon deals on a successful attack.

**STR/DEX:** The minimum STR and DEX scores needed to easily wield this weapon. For every point a Characteristic is below these minimums, a –5% penalty is applied to a Adventurer's skill when attacking and parrying with this weapon.

**Size** : Each weapon possesses a size rating. This is related to its mass, leverage and stability.

The value is used to determine both the weapon's ability to inflict and parry damage. The size categories are Small (S), Medium (M), Large (L), Huge (H) and Enormous (E).

**Reach** : The weapon's length, how far it can reach in combat (see page 139). The size categories are Touch (T), Short (S), Medium (M), Long (L) and Very Long (VL).

**Combat Manoeuvres** : The Combat Manoeuvres (see the Combat chapter) a weapon can inflict  - such as Bashing, Impale and so forth.

**ENC:** The weight and bulk of the weapon. See page 86 for more details on Encumbrance and its effects on Adventurers.

**AP/HP:** The Armour Points and Hit Points possessed by the weapon. When Hit Points reach 0, the weapon is broken and useless.

**Cost** : The average cost in silver pieces to purchase this weapon.

#### Close Combat Weapon Descriptions

**Ball and Chain:** This heavy metal ball attached to a short length of chain is notoriously difficult to parry. An opponent attempting to parry this weapon treats his parrying weapon or shield as one step smaller for the purposes of blocking damage. However, the wielder also suffers the same penalty when trying to Parry with the ball and chain.

**Battleaxe:** A single-bladed weapon with a sturdy haft, the battleaxe may be used with one or two hands, depending on the wielder's preference. A battleaxe can be used to bash through doors and obstacles rather quickly. It suffers no damage when attacking inanimate wooden objects.

**Buckler:** This small, round shield is held in the hand and used to 'punch block' incoming blows.

Bucklers are often used to attack with the off-hand, when the main weapon is tied up. Its small size however, provides little protection against larger weapons or missile fire.

**Chain:** This two metre length of chain is one step above using an improvised weapon. It is very difficult to parry, any weapon interposed against a chain is treated as one step smaller for the purpose of blocking damage. However, the wielder also suffers the same penalty when parrying with this weapon. If an opponent is caught by surprise, it can also be used as a garrotte.

**Club:** Perhaps the simplest of all weapons and almost certainly the oldest, the club is simply a long, stout piece of wood used to bludgeon others. However, there are several cultures that have carved clubs made of stone, or bone – all of which can be sculpted or decorated according to the wielder's preference.

**Dagger:** Essentially a large knife attached to a short handle, the dagger is often carried as a backup or parrying weapon. Thieves, assassins and bandits often enjoy the use of daggers because they can be hidden and drawn with ease. Daggers are usually well-balanced enough to throw effectively.

**Dirk:** This is a short-handled, wide-bladed weapon about half-again the size of a dagger. It is commonly used as a secondary weapon, even though it promises sufficient damage any time its blade bites flesh. Parrying with a dirk increases the damage blocked by one step (i.e. it is treated as a Medium weapon when parrying).

**Falchion:** A single edged, cleaver-like sword that delivers heavy, chopping blows.

**Garrotte:** An assassin's weapon, the garrotte is a cord, chain or thin braided metal wire used to loop around a target's neck and strangle him. Only usable during a grapple or from behind on an unsuspecting victim, the garrotte inflicts its damage each and every Combat Action the wielder continues to actively crush his victim's throat. Whilst being strangled, the victim can attempt to wrestle free, or damage his opponent so badly they are forced to let go – but acts at a penalty due to the strangler being directly behind him.

**Great Axe:** Up to two metres in length, dwarfing the battleaxe in size, the great axe may be either single or double-bladed and must be used with both hands. It also suffers no damage when used to break inanimate wooden objects.

**Great Club:** Little more than a massive branch of wood banded in metal, a great club is much less a designed weapon and more a makeshift one. Some cultures might create their own varieties of other materials but overall the great club is the weapon of choice for low-intelligence, low- resource beings of massive strength and size.

**Great Hammer:** The great hammer, or maul, is an enormous weapon that deals impressive bludgeoning damage. It is a tool as well as a weapon and can sometimes be found with a pick- like spike on the back portion of its head. Great hammers may be used on inanimate objects without being destroyed.

**Great Sword:** This group nomenclature pertains to a number of massive blades that can be found as much as two metres in length. They are used by those warriors who want the enemy at more than arm's length, or cleaved beneath the sheering power of the weapon's strike. Part of the blade is unsharpened and leather-bound on many great swords, allowing the wielder to grip them for more effective parries.

**Halberd:** An axe head combined with a thrusting tip and a hook, mounted on a spear shaft, the halberd is a multi-purpose weapon. Halberdiers are versatile opponents that can bring any version of the weapon's attack to bear in an instant.

**Hatchet:** A simple and cheap one-handed cleaving tool, the hatchet is essentially a smaller version of an axe. It can be used to cut through wooden inanimate objects with no risk to its edge. A hatchet is usually well-balanced enough to throw effectively and many users prefer to call these items 'throwing axes'.

**Heater Shield:** A medium sized shield designed for both mounted and foot use. Most are reinforced with metal edging and commonly have some form of symbol or insignia painted on the outside face. Heater shields can parry ranged weapons.

**Hoplite Shield:** Large circular shields designed for foot combat, which are edged and sometimes faced with metal. This shield is an excellent defence against even two handed weapons and provides decent cover against missile attacks.

**Kite Shield:** Kite shields are large shields with an inverted teardrop shape. This shield can switch between both infantry and mounted use and is extremely popular for those who spend time in both types of combats. Kite shields are also effective against ranged weapons.

**Knife:** Knives can be made from a sharp piece of metal, stone, bone or even glass. They almost always have a short hilt carved from wood. More commonly a tool than a weapon, the knife is a multi-purpose item that should be found in every Adventurer's backpack.

**Lance:** An oversized spear designed to be used from the back of a mount, a lance can be a devastating weapon when charging. A mounted character who uses a lance during a charge may add his mount's Damage Modifier instead of his own to the damage.

**Long Spear:** The long spear is a lengthy piercing weapon with a wide bladed head, often used in ranked units to defeat charging cavalry.

**Longsword:** The longsword is a versatile sword with an elongated grip, which allows it to be wielded with either one hand or two. Its extra length adds to its reach and used two handed, it inflicts greater damage.

**Mace:** The mace is comprised of a large flanged or knobbed weight mounted on one end of a haft, which is often reinforced with metal. Its ability to incapacitate, even heavily armoured opponents, makes this a popular weapon in civilised cultures.

**Main Gauche:** Also called a 'parrying dagger', the main gauche is a long-bladed dagger with two extremely long and strong quillions. It is normally used in the off-hand in conjunction with a longsword, rapier or sabre. Parrying with a main gauche increases the damage blocked by one step (i.e. it is treated as a Medium weapon when parrying).

**Military Flail:** This is a heavy metal ball or rod, usually bristling with spikes or edged flanges, attached to a wooden haft by a short length of chain. Due to its flexible construction, an opponent defending against this weapon treats his parrying weapon or shield as one step smaller for the purposes of blocking damage. However, the wielder also suffers the same penalty when trying to Parry with the flail.

**Military Pick:** Also known as a war hammer, a military pick is a short shafted weapon that has a metal head with a hammer face on one side and a curved pick on the other. The military pick is designed to pierce heavy armour but can also be used on inanimate objects without being destroyed.

**Morningstar:** Carved from a length of wood nearly a metre long, the morningstar is a bladed or spiked cudgel.

**Net:** Used by gladiators, huntsmen and watchmen, the net is more than a mere fishing net to be tossed at a target. A fighter's net is made of thick cord and leather, tipped with numerous hooks and heavy weights. It can be swung like a flail, the weights lashing out to batter an opponent, inflicting the damage listed.

**Poleaxe:** A polearm about the height of a man, it is has a hammer head backed with a metal spike and a spear tip for thrusting. This style of two handed war hammer, is very popular against heavy armour types.

**Poniard:** This duellist's weapon is a long dagger, designed to be thrust into a target.

**Quarterstaff:** A simple staff, sometimes banded with metal at either end. In the hands of a skilled user, it is a fast and effective weapon for both offence and defence and can be hidden in plain sight as a shepherd's hook or simple traveller's walking staff.

**Rapier:** Fast and light, the rapier relies more on the thrust than the slash. It is a particularly effective weapon, especially considering its reach.

**Sabre:** The sabre is a slightly curved sword, designed to be used for slashing or thrusting when mounted. It has a basket hilt which adds one Armour Point to the limb being used to wield it.

**Scimitar:** A broad-bladed sword, the scimitar has a dramatically curved edge designed for cutting and slashing. It is sometimes wider than a normal sheath can hold and is more often hung from straps or some form of netting.

**Shortspear:** Heftier than a javelin and fitted with a broader head made for stabbing; a short spear is commonly used in conjunction with a shield. The short spear is a popular and ubiquitous weapon, being cheap to manufacture and having a reach advantage over most other single handed weapons.

**Shortsword:** The shortsword is a straight, broad-bladed sword designed for thrusting. It does carry an edge along its sides but use of the edge is always secondary to the thrusting point.

**Target:** A medium sized, round shield made of wood and covered with hide. A target mounts a long spike on its central boss, making the shield a dangerous weapon, as well as being able to parry ranged weapons.

**Trident:** Another tool turned weapon, a trident is a three-pronged or bladed spear that once was used to catch fish in the same way as a harpoon. If a trident impales, its barbed prongs do an extra point of damage when being ripped free.

**War Sword:** The most common sword type available, the war sword is generally slightly less than a metre in length and possesses a sharpened tip to thrust with. It is the ubiquitous weapon of choice amongst many Adventurers.

### Ranged Combat Weapons

Just as Close Combat weapons are defined by certain qualities, so are Ranged weapons.

**Category:** The type of weapon this is. This is used as a basis for Combat Styles.

**Damage Dice:** The damage the weapon deals on a successful attack.

**Range:** This is the effective range of the weapon. The maximum range a weapon can be fired or thrown is twice this score.

**Load:** This shows how many Combat Actions are required to load or reload the weapon.

**STR/DEX:** The minimum STR and DEX scores needed to easily wield this weapon. For every point a Characteristic is below these minimums, a –5% penalty is applied to an Adventurer's skill when attacking with this weapon.

**Size** : Each ranged weapon possesses a size rating. In the case of projectile weapons, this does not relate to the firing weapon itself but rather to how 'forceful' its ammunition is. The value is used to determine whether the weapon can overcome any shield which may parry it. The size categories are Small (S), Medium (M), Large (L), Huge (H) and Enormous (E).

**Combat Manoeuvres** : Any specific Combat Manoeuvres applicable to the weapon or its ammunition.

**ENC:** The weight and bulk of the weapon. See page 86 for more details on Encumbrance and its effects on Adventurers.

**AP/HP:** The Armour Points and Hit Points possessed by the weapon. When Hit Points reach zero, the weapon is broken and useless.

**Cost:** The average cost in Silver Pieces to purchase this weapon.

#### Ranged Combat Weapon Descriptions

**Arbalest:** This is a metal-armed crossbow that when stood on its end is as tall as a man. It fires specially crafted arbalest bolts that have been reinforced in order to withstand the sheer force that its braided cord propels them at. Able to drive a finger-thick bolt a full hand's depth into an oak tree, the arbalest hits with force enough to punch through armour as if it were thin cloth but requires the use of a windlass to re-cock it. An Adventurer's Damage Modifier is never applied when he is using an arbalest.

**Blowgun:** This is a hollow tube or pipe, usually made of wood or bone, which expels a tiny dart when its user blows on one end. As the dart itself is capable of negligible damage, blowguns are seldom used without some kind of poison. An Adventurer's Damage Modifier is never applied when he is using a blowgun. If fired at someone wearing more protection than normal clothing, it requires the Combat Manoeuvre of either Bypass Armour or Choose Location to strike flesh.

**Bolas:** A thrown weapon comprising of two or more weights tied together with lengths of cord.

Whirled and released, the bolas works by entangling its target in the cords and inflicts damage from the winding weights. Unlike other Ranged weapons, the bolas cannot be parried by shields.

It may only be evaded.

(^2) This weapon suffers no penalty when thrown.
(^3) This weapon may Parry Ranged weapons.

**Dart:** A dart resembles an arrow with a longer head and shorter shaft (usually slightly less than half a metre in length). Darts are rarely a warrior's weapon and are found in the hands of small game huntsmen and roguish Adventurers.

**Discus:** A discus is a flat disc made of stone or metal. Hurling the discus is an old sport and show of physical prowess. However, someone who is good enough with a discus could easily split skin and shatter bone with a forceful throw.

**Heavy Crossbow:** Similar in concept to the light crossbow, this version is larger and reinforced with metal bands to handle the immense pull of the string. Many heavy crossbows come with a metal stirrup so the firer can use his foot for leverage, or a crank to pull back the thick string. An Adventurer's Damage Modifier is never applied when he is using a heavy crossbow.

**Javelin:** The javelin is a spear-like weapon with a narrow, pointed head designed for throwing short distances. The thrower of a javelin may use _Pin Weapon_ as a Combat Manoeuvre, against a parrying shield. In this circumstance, the pinned shield cannot be used until the javelin has been removed (which takes one round).

**Light Crossbow:** A simple mechanical bow, the light crossbow often sees service in small armies that lack training in other types of Ranged weapons. It can be clutched in one hand and reloaded with the other, making it a good infantryman's weapon. An Adventurer's Damage Modifier is never applied when he is using a light crossbow.

**Long Bow:** A long bow has a shaft as much as two metres in length and is designed to be fired on foot. A long bow cannot be used from horseback.

**Net:** A net can be hurled at an opponent within five metres. Due to its engulfing size, a thrown net may only be evaded, not parried.

**Recurve Bow:** A recurve, or composite bow is made from a laminated combination of wood, sinew, horn and sometimes even bone. When strung the bow's forward-angled arms give it a distinctive shape, allowing it to be as strong as a long bow but without the length. Recurve bows are mainly used by mounted archers and nomads, since the reduced size means that it does not catch on the mount that it is fired from.

**Short Bow:** Designed to be fired from horseback, the short bow is equally useful as a foot soldier's weapon. It is a good hunting tool as well as a weapon of war and when used to hunt deer and smaller game animals it can make all the difference.

**Sling:** A sling is a long strip of cloth or leather used to fling a stone or bullet at a target. It is as lethal as a bow, able to injure or kill those wearing heavy armour. Many slings also have a sewn-in leather cup or pad in which to hold the projectile while gathering velocity. A sling's range makes it useful against archers.

**Staff Sling:** A simple sling mounted on the end of a wooden haft, the staff sling is used by whipping the shaft overhead to cast its load. Although it cannot match the sling for range, it can be used to throw heavier stones or burning jars of oil (or other noxious substances) in high arcs over walls and fortifications. When not being used as a sling, the leather cup and cord can be wound around the haft and lashed down, effectively turning the staff sling into a quarterstaff.

**Trident:** See entry in Close Combat Weapons.

#### Ranged Weapon Ammunition

The following table lists specific types of ammunition, how sturdy they might be, whether they weigh enough to have an ENC score and their cost. Please note that unless an entry has a (#) after its name, the price listed is for a single item.

**Arbalest bolts:** Made of metal-shod hardwood roughly as thick as a man's thumb, arbalest bolts are tipped with heavy metal heads that resemble a stiletto or dagger. They use small fletching from waxy-feathered fowl and are remarkably accurate, if only due to the sheer force with which they are fired.

**Arrows, Bodkin:** These arrows are the most commonly used ammunition in _Legend_. They possess narrow spikes for points. While not as simple to make as sling bullets, they are far more popular for their multiple utilities.

**Arrow, Broadhead:** While a normal arrow can cause quite a wound, these arrows have broad cutting surfaces that inflict greater damage, at the expense of range. Using a broadhead arrow reduces the distance it can be fired by 25% but inflicts an extra two points of damage on **_unarmoured_** opponents.

**Arrow, Fishing:** More of a tool than a weapon, the fishing arrow is a thin-headed arrow that has a set of three small barbs facing backwards to catch and hold a wriggling fish. It also has almost no fletching at all (it interferes with underwater propulsion) but rather a small metal ring onto which cord or twine can be tied to retrieve a shot fish. Using fishing arrows to catch fish grants a +10% bonus to Survival Skill Tests.

**Arrow, Signal:** Not made for combat at all, signal arrows have a hollow head bored out in the same fashion as a shrilling whistle. When fired (preferably upward into the air) the arrow corkscrews and emits a distinct and piercing wail that can be heard on a clear day for up to five kilometres. If actually fired at a target, the arrow has a –20% penalty to hit and will cause half damage if successful.

**Blowgun Darts:** Blowgun darts are small, thin needles or stubby miniature arrowheads that often have a tuft of down or cotton at the end in order to catch the rush of air in a blowgun. They are not designed to do damage but can deliver a single dose of poison to a target quite easily – if the firer can manage to bypass his armour, of course.

**Crossbow Bolts:** Simple and stout, bolts are miniature arrows with smaller fletching designed to carry the bolt on existing force rather than keep it aloft. They tend to have thinner, more compact heads of metal on them to drive deeper with the impact but some have the wider hunting heads commonly seen on arrows. Bolts tend to be thicker than arrows and are purchased to fit a specific type of crossbow – wrist, light, medium or heavy.

**Sling Bullets:** Stone or lead ovals that can reach surprising speeds and accuracy when hurled by a skilled user. Bullets can be retrieved rather easily and most can even be hammered or rolled back into a usable shape with little effort (as lead becomes soft when heated slightly).

#### Using Ranged Weapons in Close Combat

Just as Close Combat weapons are not designed to be thrown, so most Ranged weapons are not generally designed to be used in Close Combat. Sometimes, however, Adventurers will be left with no option but to club someone with a crossbow butt or stab an enemy with an arrow...

If used in Close Combat, a projectile weapon or its ammunition is usually treated as an improvised weapon. Use the most applicable combat skill the Adventurer has but apply a –2 modifier to any damage rolled, reflecting the inappropriate use of the weapon.

## Food and Lodging

Merchants, explorers and Adventurers can rarely expect to sleep in their own beds every night if, indeed, they possess homes. The following therefore illustrate the cost of living for those who are perpetually on the road.

## General Items

The following items, whilst billed as general, cover a range of specifics as well as day-to-day adventuring needs. Some are more useful than others but resourceful Adventurers will be able to find a use for just about any of the items listed in the following General Items table.

Each item has a description noting any specifics or game effects. The Cultures column notes which Cultural Backgrounds are _most likely_ to have access to the item – although this is offered as a guideline only. If an item has no ENC value, it is light enough to be negligible when carried.

Oil, Jellied Mixing sawdust, chalk or hoof shavings into
common lamp oil slowly over a period of time can
eventually create a combustible jelly that is very
useful for smearing on torches and other objects
that are to be set alight at a later time. A single

Torch, 1
hour

```
A torch has one end wrapped in cloth and dipped
in pitch or a similar flammable substance. It can
be lit with flint and tinder in one round and will
burn for one hour. A torch illuminates a three
metre radius. If used as a weapon, it is considered
a club (wielded with a –10% penalty), except that
it does not inflict normal damage – instead, it
inflicts 1D4 fire damage and a fumble or critical
hit will also extinguish the brand.

Waterskin A lined bladder or sewn leather pouch designed to

other liquids equally well.

Wax, block Used for a variety of reasons in several professions,
beeswax is much like rope in that many
Adventurers find ways to put it to inventive use.
Thieves will press keys into it in order to make
effective forgeries, mages might need it to seal up
potions or component bottles and so on.

Writing kit The basic writing kit contains several vials of black
ink, as well as brushes, quills and pens used for

The normal amount the animal can carry without being overloaded is given in the ENC Carried column. As for Adventurers, mounts and beasts of burden can become overloaded if this figure is exceeded, suffering a –20% penalty to skill rolls and Fatigue tests. No animal can carry more than double the ENC Carried value.

## Transportation

### Riding and Animal Supplies

The Riding and Animal Supplies table shows a number of items and supplies that Adventurer could find very useful when dealing with animals (like those found in the Beasts and Cohorts chapter of this book), how much they weigh in ENC and their general market cost.

Bit and
Bridle
```
```
This is a short piece of leather or metal that is placed in the
mouth of a mount and attached to a set of leather or chain
reins to allow the rider or driver to steer the beast. Although
it does not offer any sort of bonus to Riding or Driving tests,
not having a bit and bridle on a mount when an Adventurer
Critically Fumbles one of these tests can be catastrophic (at
the Games Master's discretion).
```
###### 1 15 SP

```
Crop The crop is a piece of wood, bone or metal with a folded
leather strap at the end. It is used to force a mount to push
harder. Spurring movement with the stinging and noisy
'crack' of a crop on the hindquarters of a ridden mount can
sometimes bring higher speeds. In game terms this allows
a rider to make an additional Riding Skill Test to increase
speed, though he can only do so three turns in a row before
the mount becomes numb or angry.
```
###### — 15 SP

```
Driver's
whip
```
```
A length of thin and flexible wood tipped with a long, thin
piece of resin-coated cord or braided leather, a driver's whip
is used to sting the flanks of drawing mounts from the
driver's bench of a wagon, coach or cart. It is used to bring
higher speeds out of the entire team. In game terms this
allows a driver to make an additional Driving Skill Test to
increase speed but he can only do so a number of turns in a
row equal to the number of drawing mounts attached to the
vehicle before the team becomes inured.
```
###### — 25 SP

```
Falconer's
Kit
```
```
This kit includes a thick leather glove or gauntlet with cord
sewn to it in order to tether a falcon or hunting hawk when
at rest. It also includes a leather or wooden hood that fits
over the eyes and ears of the bird in an effort to keep the
animal calm before releasing it to perform its duties. Anyone
attempting to perform Craft (Falconry) Skill Tests without a
full falconer's kit suffers a –10% penalty to his Skill Test.
```
###### 1 30 SP

```
Feed/mount
rations (per
day)
```
```
Whether it is a supply of corn mash and oats for a stallion,
sardines for a sea lion or osprey, or chunks of raw horsemeat
for a griffon, this category covers the road rations needed
to keep a mount healthy and strong. If they do not pack
additional feed, Adventurers will need to make additional
Survival or Tracking rolls every week in order to keep their
mounts from becoming sickly or unruly.
```

Goad A thick-hafted piece of ivory, bone or wood tipped with a
rounded hook and jabbing pinion, a goad is like a riding
crop for thicker-skinned beasts, such as reptiles, pachyderms,
rhinos and the like.

###### 1 25 SP

Saddle,
flight

```
A specialised saddle designed for beasts with wings like
griffons and sky bulls, this is a must for aerial cavalry. The
flight saddle has additional thigh stirrups that keep a rider
tethered to the animal as it flies. The straps are difficult to
unlatch when in motion – requiring a Mechanisms roll at
+10% to do so in combat.
```
###### 3 100 SP

Saddle, pack This is basically a riding saddle with two sets of attached saddlebags and an additional wooden cage for goods where a rider would normally sit. The pack saddle can carry an impressive 40 ENC of weight but leaves no room for a rider.

###### 5 65 SP

Saddle,
riding

```
This is the most common form of leather saddle and is the
style that most riders prefer for long trips. Even though it
does not offer any sort of bonus to Riding Skill Tests, riding
a horse at anything faster than a brisk walk without one
imposes a –10% penalty to Riding.
```
###### 3 60 SP

Saddle, war The heaviest of saddles, a war saddle has a raised front horn and padded back in order to support an armoured rider and several additional buckles to attach to barding. Using a war saddle inflicts one level of Fatigue per full eight hours of use but it does add +10% to any Riding Skill Tests made during combat, or when resisting knockback.

###### 4 90 SP

Saddlebag A pair of canvas, leather or cloth bags designed to be draped
over the shoulders or flanks of a mount in order for it to
carry more equipment or goods for the owner. A saddlebag
can carry 15 ENC worth of weight.

###### 2 20 SP

Shoes, horse Common metal shoes nailed to the bottom of hoofed
animals, 'horse' shoes are designed to keep sharp stones and
gravel from chipping or splitting a hoof. Hoofed mounts
that do not have shoes will need to be rested more frequently
in order to remove detritus, imposing a –10% penalty to
travel times through any type of rocky or stony terrain.
